# datasciencecoursera
This repository is used for class assignments
I first created Repo and named it datasciencecoursera
I secondly ubmitted a link to my github account
Thirdly I created a Branch  and named it GBHellowWorld
Then I Created a text file and named it HellowWorld and added the markdone statement.
I believed I pushed the document to my repo datasciencecoursera and submitted a link to the HelloWorld file.  
This is where my problem start I cannot get my Fork to work correctly.
